# ChemMLabel Standard

## The Universal Language for Materials Data in the AI Age

 **Vision: Unlocking the Future of Materials with AI**  
The world of materials science and chemistry is rich with data, yet it remains largely fragmented, inconsistent, and difficult for machines to interpret. This "dark data" significantly slows down innovation, research, and the adoption of advanced AI and Machine Learning in critical industries.

**ChemMLabel** is our answer. We envision a future where every material, every chemical, and every product—from its atomic composition to its complex assembly—can be described in a single, standardized, and machine-readable chemical language. This universal language will empower AI to:

- Accelerate discovery  
- Optimize manufacturing  
- Drive sustainable solutions

##  What is ChemMLabel?

**ChemMLabel** is an open-source data standard designed to provide a **comprehensive, hierarchical, and unambiguous** representation of materials and chemical entities. It's built on **JSON Schema** to ensure strict validation and seamless integration with computational tools.

###  Key Components of the Standard

- **Hierarchical Composition**  
  Represent anything from pure elements and compounds to complex alloys, polymers, composites, and multi-component assemblies (like a battery or a car), detailing their chemical makeup at any level of granularity.

- **Structured Properties**  
  Quantify material properties with associated units, conditions (e.g., temperature, pressure), and measurement/simulation methods.

- **Processing & Provenance**  
  Capture vital information about how materials are manufactured, treated, and where their data originated from.

- **External Linking**  
  Include references to industry standards, external databases, and raw data attachments.

- **Machine-First Design**  
  Optimized for direct consumption by machine learning algorithms, reducing data preparation overhead.

##  Project Structure

This repository contains the foundational assets for the **ChemMLabel** standard:

- **`schema/`**: Contains the official JSON Schema definition of the ChemMLabel standard (`chemlabel_schema_v1_1.json`). This is the core blueprint.

- **`tools/python/`**: Python utilities for parsing, serializing, and validating ChemMLabel JSON data.
